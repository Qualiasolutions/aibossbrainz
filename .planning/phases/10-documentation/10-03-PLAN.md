<objective>
Record GIF of profile dropdown menu navigation

Purpose: This GIF will be embedded in Mailchimp onboarding Email 1 to show users how to navigate the app. It demonstrates the profile dropdown menu interaction.

Output: High-quality GIF showing: user clicks profile area -> dropdown menu opens -> Account option is highlighted/visible.
</objective>

<execution_context>
This is a MANUAL plan. GIF recording requires screen recording software.

Recommended tools:
- **macOS**: Built-in Screen Recording (Cmd+Shift+5), then convert with Gifski or CloudConvert
- **macOS alternative**: LICEcap (free, direct GIF capture)
- **Windows**: ScreenToGif (free, excellent)
- **Cross-platform**: ShareX, Kap, or Peek (Linux)
- **Browser extension**: Chrome's "Capture to GIF"

For best results:
- Record at actual size (no scaling)
- Keep duration short (3-5 seconds)
- Use 15-20 fps
- Optimize file size (<2MB for email)

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Set up recording environment</name>
  <action>
    Prepare for GIF recording:

    1. **Browser setup**:
       - Open https://bossbrainz.aleccimedia.com in Chrome/Firefox
       - Log in as demo@aibossbrainz.com
       - Navigate to chat interface
       - Ensure sidebar is visible (not collapsed)
       - Position browser window for optimal capture

    2. **Profile area location**:
       - Bottom-left corner of chat interface
       - Shows user avatar/initials and display name
       - Clicking opens dropdown with: Homepage, Account, Pricing, Contact, Sign out

    3. **Recording area**:
       - Focus capture on the profile area and dropdown
       - Include enough context to show it's part of the app
       - Approximate capture area: 300x400 pixels around profile section

    4. **Test the interaction**:
       - Click profile area
       - Dropdown appears
       - Move mouse to hover over "Account"
       - Note the animation/transition speed

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Record and create GIF</name>
  <action>
    Record the profile dropdown interaction:

    **The sequence to capture:**
    1. Start with cursor near (but not on) profile area
    2. Move cursor to profile area
    3. Click to open dropdown
    4. Pause briefly to show menu items
    5. Move cursor to "Account" option (highlight it)
    6. Optional: show the hover state
    7. End recording

    **Recording tips:**
    - Keep mouse movements smooth and deliberate
    - Pause long enough on each state for viewers to see
    - Total duration: 3-5 seconds
    - If using screen record + convert, record at 30fps then convert to 15fps GIF

    **Save the GIF:**
    - docs/demo/gifs/profile-dropdown.gif

    **Optimization:**
    - Target file size: <2MB (Mailchimp email friendly)
    - If too large, reduce: fps, colors, or dimensions
    - Tools like gifsicle or ezgif.com can optimize
