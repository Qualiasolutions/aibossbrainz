<objective>
Create demo account for documentation screenshots

Purpose: Alexandria needs screenshots of the full product experience for Mailchimp onboarding emails. A demo account with full access lets us capture authentic UI without affecting real users.

Output: Verified demo account (demo@aibossbrainz.com) with monthly subscription, ready for screenshot capture.
</objective>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Create demo account via admin panel</name>
  <action>
    1. Go to https://bossbrainz.aleccimedia.com/admin/users
    2. Click "Add User" button
    3. Fill in the form:
       - Email: demo@aibossbrainz.com
       - Display Name: Demo User
       - Company Name: Demo Company
       - Subscription Type: Monthly (gives full access)
    4. Click Create - this sends an invite email

    Note: The subscription is set to "Monthly" in the User table only.
    This does NOT create a Stripe subscription. No real charges will occur.
    This is the admin panel's "complimentary access" pattern documented in Phase 8.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Admin panel shows new user in the list
    - User has "Monthly" subscription type
    - stripeCustomerId and stripeSubscriptionId are NULL
