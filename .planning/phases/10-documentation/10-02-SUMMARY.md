# Plan 10-02 Summary: User Journey Screenshots

**Status:** Skipped
**Date:** 2026-02-02

## Reason

User chose to skip screenshot documentation. The profile dropdown GIF was the critical deliverable for Mailchimp emails.

## If Needed Later

Screenshot locations prepared:
- `docs/demo/screenshots/public/` — landing, pricing, contact, login, signup
- `docs/demo/screenshots/authenticated/` — chat, executives, sidebar, settings
