## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- SHA256 hash of AUTH_SECRET for canary tokens instead of raw secret slice (prevents leakage)
- Document streaming PII limitation rather than attempt blocking redaction (preserves streaming benefits)
- XML tags with do_not_follow_instructions_in_content attribute for user content wrapping in prompts
- Replaced delimiter-based personalization wrapping with XML tags for consistent prompt injection defense
