**Phases:** 6-10
**Total Plans:** 8

## Overview

Address all bug fixes, UX improvements, and integration requests from Alexandria's January 2026 review. This milestone resolved critical user-facing issues, updated branding, documented billing behavior, integrated Mailchimp for trial automation, and created documentation assets for email marketing.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Bug Fixes & UX

**Goal:** Fix the admin panel 404 error, unpin bug, and email confirmation redirect.

### Phase 10: Documentation

**Goal:** Create demo account and capture screenshots/GIFs for Mailchimp emails.
**Depends on:** Phase 6 + 7
**Plans:** 3 plans (2 skipped)

Plans:
- [~] 10-01-PLAN.md - Create demo account — Skipped
- [~] 10-02-PLAN.md - Document user journey — Skipped
- [x] 10-03-PLAN.md - Record profile dropdown GIF via Remotion

**Details:**
- DOC-01: Skipped - Remotion approach eliminated need for demo account
- DOC-02: Skipped - GIF was the critical deliverable
- DOC-03: Created `docs/demo/gifs/profile-dropdown.gif` (443KB, 5 seconds)

**Actual Outcome:**
- GIF created programmatically via Remotion (professional quality)
- File size: 443KB (email-friendly)

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**
- Documentation-only approach for billing (no code changes needed)
- Strict consistency for Mailchimp API calls (block webhook on failure, Stripe will retry)
- Remotion for GIF creation (better than screen recording)
- Graceful degradation when env vars missing (build succeeds without Mailchimp config)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Admin panel 404 on user details
- Unpin conversation state sync bug
- Email confirmation redirect to wrong page
- Billing behavior confusion for legacy users
- Missing Mailchimp integration for trial automation

**Issues Deferred:**
- MAIL-04/05/06: Mailchimp automation UI work (outside platform codebase)
- Demo account and full screenshot documentation (not needed after Remotion approach)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Subscribe page receives `?welcome=true` but doesn't display special message (cosmetic, low priority)
- Human verification needed for billing documentation (Alexandria must execute checklists)
